# Kafka-Challenge
Given is the streaming data encoded in a morse code. In this challenge, first 1000 records are needed to be tapped and certain records are required to be filtered and saved in an output.txt file. 

There is nothing much to explain as it is very simple.

-----Run docker-compose up in cmd and it will start producing the encoded data.
-----Run consumer.py and it will tap on the first 1000 offsets and will compare each single word in each offset message with 'Australia' and will filter them. 



These are the output messages on our requirement.
